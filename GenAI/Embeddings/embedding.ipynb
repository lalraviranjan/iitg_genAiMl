    "#### Embedding Techniques\n",
    "##### Converting Texts into Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo how to use OpenAI embeddings to convert text into vector representations and store them in a vector database for similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps Covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Environment Variables**:\n",
    "   - Use the `dotenv` library to load API keys and other configurations from a `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up OpenAI Embeddings**:\n",
    "   - Use the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class to generate embeddings for text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Text Documents**:\n",
    "   - Load text files (e.g., `speech.txt`) using `TextLoader`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clean and Preprocess Text**:\n",
    "   - Remove special characters, normalize whitespace, and split text into manageable chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Store Embeddings in a Vector Database**:\n",
    "   - Use `Chroma` to store embeddings in a persistent vector database.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Perform Similarity Search**:\n",
    "   - Query the vector database to find the most similar text documents to a given query.\n",
    "\n",

Their story wasn’t just one of ordinary romance; it was woven with threads of deep connection, shared dreams, and a love that felt timeless.\\n\\nTheir journey began in the quiet charm of their hometown, where glances turned into conversations, and conversations blossomed into a bond that neither time nor distance could shake. On **28th June**, they sealed this bond with an engagement, and by **7th December 2020**, Ravi and Sweeti were tied together in the sacred knot of marriage.\\n\\nFrom the very beginning, it was clear—they were made for each other.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Chapter 1: A Love That Travels\\n\\nTo celebrate their **first anniversary in 2021**, Ravi whisked Sweeti away to the misty hills of **Sikkim and Darjeeling**. The cool air, the tea gardens, and the charm of the toy train enchanted Sweeti. She stood on a quiet ridge in Darjeeling, watching the clouds flirt with the mountains, and whispered, “I could stay here forever.” Ravi just smiled, taking mental pictures of her joy—because that’s what he loved the most.\\n\\nBut this wasn’t the first time Ravi was swept away by wanderlust. Back in **2019**, before their marriage, he fulfilled a long-held dream: a **bike trip from Manali to Ladakh**. It was a rugged, soul-searching adventure, but all through those miles, he imagined what it would feel like to share such journeys with someone he loved.\\n\\nAnd now, with Sweeti by his side, every trip was more than a destination—it was a memory in the making.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Chapter 2: Mountains, Memories, and Munnar\\n\\nTheir **third anniversary** brought another adventure—**Kerala**. They wandered through the hills of **Munnar**, glided along the backwaters of **Alleppey**, and watched sunsets at **Varkala Beach**. But it was Munnar that stole Sweeti’s heart—the rolling tea gardens, the whispering winds, and the misty mornings felt almost magical. She held Ravi’s hand tightly and said, “Let’s promise to come back here, every few years.” And Ravi, the romantic soul he is, nodded with a smile that said he’d already marked the calendar in his heart.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Chapter 3: Milestones and Motorcars\\n\\nIn **August 2023**, they welcomed a new member into their little family—a **Tata Punch**, their very first car. It wasn’t just a vehicle, it was a symbol of how far they had come together—from dreams to destinations, from hopes to achievements. Every road trip now had a new rhythm, and every drive became a song of togetherness.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Chapter 4: Growing Together\\n\\nSweeti wasn’t just a dreamer—she was Ravi’s biggest cheerleader. Seeing Ravi’s dedication at **JP Morgan**, and his passion for learning, she felt inspired. So, she enrolled in an **M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** at **CBIT**, not just to grow, but to walk side by side with Ravi into a future full of possibilities.\\n\\nRavi, meanwhile, began exploring the vast world of **AI and Machine Learning**. He knew that with the right skills, they could build a life not just filled with love, but one enriched by purpose and success.\\n\\nThey weren’t just building a home—they were building a future, hand in hand.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Epilogue: Forever Starts Every Day\\n\\nSome love stories aren’t about grand gestures or dramatic turns. They’re about quiet mornings, shared dreams, road trips, late-night study sessions, and holding hands through every season of life. \\n\\nRavi and Sweeti’s story is exactly that—a reminder that **true love is made in heaven, but lived every day on Earth** with patience, passion, and partnership.\\n\\nAnd somewhere in the heart of Darbhanga, their journey continues—one sunset, one milestone, and one dream at a time.\\n')]"
