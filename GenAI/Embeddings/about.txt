**A Love Story from Darbhanga: Ravi & Sweeti – A Journey Made in Heaven**

In the heart of Bihar, nestled within the cultural town of Darbhanga, destiny brought together two beautiful souls—Ravi and Sweeti. Their story wasn’t just one of ordinary romance; it was woven with threads of deep connection, shared dreams, and a love that felt timeless.

Their journey began in the quiet charm of their hometown, where glances turned into conversations, and conversations blossomed into a bond that neither time nor distance could shake. On **28th June**, they sealed this bond with an engagement, and by **7th December 2020**, Ravi and Sweeti were tied together in the sacred knot of marriage.

From the very beginning, it was clear—they were made for each other.

### Chapter 1: A Love That Travels

To celebrate their **first anniversary in 2021**, Ravi whisked Sweeti away to the misty hills of **Sikkim and Darjeeling**. The cool air, the tea gardens, and the charm of the toy train enchanted Sweeti. She stood on a quiet ridge in Darjeeling, watching the clouds flirt with the mountains, and whispered, “I could stay here forever.” Ravi just smiled, taking mental pictures of her joy—because that’s what he loved the most.

But this wasn’t the first time Ravi was swept away by wanderlust. Back in **2019**, before their marriage, he fulfilled a long-held dream: a **bike trip from Manali to Ladakh**. It was a rugged, soul-searching adventure, but all through those miles, he imagined what it would feel like to share such journeys with someone he loved.

And now, with Sweeti by his side, every trip was more than a destination—it was a memory in the making.

### Chapter 2: Mountains, Memories, and Munnar

Their **third anniversary** brought another adventure—**Kerala**. They wandered through the hills of **Munnar**, glided along the backwaters of **Alleppey**, and watched sunsets at **Varkala Beach**. But it was Munnar that stole Sweeti’s heart—the rolling tea gardens, the whispering winds, and the misty mornings felt almost magical. She held Ravi’s hand tightly and said, “Let’s promise to come back here, every few years.” And Ravi, the romantic soul he is, nodded with a smile that said he’d already marked the calendar in his heart.

### Chapter 3: Milestones and Motorcars

In **August 2023**, they welcomed a new member into their little family—a **Tata Punch**, their very first car. It wasn’t just a vehicle, it was a symbol of how far they had come together—from dreams to destinations, from hopes to achievements. Every road trip now had a new rhythm, and every drive became a song of togetherness.

### Chapter 4: Growing Together

Sweeti wasn’t just a dreamer—she was Ravi’s biggest cheerleader. Seeing Ravi’s dedication at **JP Morgan**, and his passion for learning, she felt inspired. So, she enrolled in an **M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** at **CBIT**, not just to grow, but to walk side by side with Ravi into a future full of possibilities.

Ravi, meanwhile, began exploring the vast world of **AI and Machine Learning**. He knew that with the right skills, they could build a life not just filled with love, but one enriched by purpose and success.

They weren’t just building a home—they were building a future, hand in hand.

### Epilogue: Forever Starts Every Day

Some love stories aren’t about grand gestures or dramatic turns. They’re about quiet mornings, shared dreams, road trips, late-night study sessions, and holding hands through every season of life. 

Ravi and Sweeti’s story is exactly that—a reminder that **true love is made in heaven, but lived every day on Earth** with patience, passion, and partnership.

And somewhere in the heart of Darbhanga, their journey continues—one sunset, one milestone, and one dream at a time.
