    "#### Sentence transformers in hugging face\n",
    "The Sentence Transformer is a library built on top of Hugging Face's Transformers library. It is specifically designed for tasks like sentence embeddings, semantic similarity, and clustering. It provides pre-trained models that can convert sentences or text into dense vector representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "1. Semantic Embeddings: Converts sentences into fixed-size dense vectors.\n",
    "2. Pre-trained Models: Includes models fine-tuned for tasks like semantic similarity, clustering, and information retrieval.\n",
    "3. Hugging Face Integration: Compatible with Hugging Face's Transformers library.\n",
    "    - Applications:\n",
    "    - Semantic search\n",
    "    - Clustering\n",
    "    - Text classification\n",
    "    - Question answering"
