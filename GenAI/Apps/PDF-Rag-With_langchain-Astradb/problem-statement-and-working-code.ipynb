    "### ✅ **Problem Statement:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** that can answer questions about the **Indian Budget Speech 2025** by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reading and preprocessing a PDF document,\n",
    "* Storing its content in a **vector database (Astra DB)** using **OpenAI embeddings**,\n",
    "* Creating a retriever for **semantic search**,\n",
    "* Connecting it with a **Large Language Model (LLM)** for contextual question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Working Code Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **PDF Parsing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load and extract raw text from the `indian_budget_speech_2025.pdf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Environment Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load environment variables for API keys.\n",
    "* Initialize connection to **Astra DB** via `cassio`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Model and Embedding Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load OpenAI LLM and embeddings via `OpenAI()` and `OpenAIEmbeddings()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Vector Store Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a `Cassandra` vector store object (`astra_vector_store`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Token-Aware Text Splitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `GPT2TokenizerFast` and `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to chunk the text into manageable token-based segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Insert Chunks into Vector Store**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add the tokenized chunks to `astra_vector_store` using `add_texts()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Create Vector Index Wrapper**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wrap the vector store using `VectorStoreIndexWrapper` to enable semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Set Up Retriever and RAG Chain**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a retriever from the vector index.\n",
    "* Use `RetrievalQA` to link the retriever with the LLM, enabling question answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **Query Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ask queries like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * *\"What are the tax benefits in the 2025 budget speech?\"*\n",
    "  * *\"Which sectors has government mentioned in 2025 budget?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "  The RAG pipeline retrieves relevant content and the LLM generates precise answers.\n"
